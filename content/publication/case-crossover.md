abstract: "Case-crossover models are used to quantify associations between mortality and risk factors, such as air pollution or extreme temperatures, using data only from subjects who died. We developed a scalable inference methodology for fitting case-crossover models with semi-parametric associations to very large datasets. Our approach includes principled, model-based uncertainty estimates and uses Bayesian inference without sampling algorithms. We apply our approach to large-scale studies of air pollution in Canada and extreme temperatures in India."
