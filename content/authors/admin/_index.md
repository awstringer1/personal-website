I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at the University of Toronto supervised by Patrick Brown and Jamie Stafford. I am developing methodology and computational tools for fitting a very general class of regression models to large, modern datasets. With a single framework we can fit models with linear and smooth terms, random effects, temporally and/or spatially correlated effects, and more, using deterministic approximations (no MCMC!) that scale well with dimension. I'm extending the framework to be able to handle matched case-control, aggregated spatio-temporal, and other types of complicated data seen in practice.

Outside of school I enjoy playing rock and roll and country and western music. My band, the Alex Stringer Band, plays a regular monthly gig at Grossmans Tavern in Toronto. We have been described by NOW! magazine as "playing tonight at 7 o'clock". Come check us out!
